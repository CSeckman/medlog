# Med Log

Med Log is an application designed to help track the completion of a prescription.  In October, there was a time when my daughter and my cat where both on presciptions at the same time.  Between me and my husband, keeping up with tracking the doses given was such a pain.  With Med Log, a user can log doses given to themself or someone they are caring for!

Start tracking your prescriptions [here](https://med-log-app.herokuapp.com/).

# Planning:

I used [trello](https://trello.com/b/uRqxYp1i/xplor) help track workflow, organizing tasks still needed and completed.
